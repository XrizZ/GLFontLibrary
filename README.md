# GLFontLibrary

This font rendering library was designed with ease of use and render performance in mind. I've written it in ~2012 for a windows OS with MFC. When changing the MFC specific types to more generic STL it should be easy to change it to a more platform agnostic library. The font files read by this library should be produced with BM Font Generator: http://angelcode.com/products/bmfont/ , however other tools can likely achieve the same.

detailed description following soon.
